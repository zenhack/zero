# The pandaboard expects the kernel binary to have a header telling it
# the size of the image, and the location of the entry point. We reserve
# space for this in ../boot.S, but the size is non-constant, so we have
# to patch it in after the fact. That's what this script is for.

size=`du -b MLO|awk '{print $1}'` # find the size of the binary

# I'm being lazy and not dealing with kernels bigger than 64K, but let's
# at least check for that ahead of time:
[ $(( $size < 2 ** 16 )) = 1 ]

# We first format the size as hexidecimal (which is assumed to be a
# 16 bit number (4 hex digits). then we use xxd to patch it into the
# binary.
tmpfile=`mktemp`
printf %04x $size > $tmpfile
xxd -r -p $tmpfile MLO
rm $tmpfile
