Various notes I've made while scouring the manuals

# Booting

- The pandaboard will boot a file called MLO in the root directory of the
  active primary (FAT) partition on MMC1.
  - can be fat12/16/32
  - can be a single floppy-like partition as well as mbr-style

- The MLO image must start with a so called GP header, which contains:
  - The size of the image (4 bytes)
  - The load address of the executable (4 bytes)
- The executable must be the remainder of the image.
  - The entry point should be at the very beginning of the executable.
